    "    Download a few MTA turnstile data files\n",
    "    Open up a file, use csv reader to read it, make a python dict where there is a key for each (C/A, UNIT, SCP, STATION). These are the first four columns. The value for this key should be a list of lists. Each list in the list is the rest of the columns in a row. For example, one key-value pair should look like\n",

    "For each key (basically the control area, unit, device address and station of a specific turnstile), have a list again, but let the list be comprised of just the point in time and the count of entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically means keeping only the date, time, and entries fields in each list. You can convert the date and time into datetime objects -- That is a python class that represents a point in time. You can combine the date and time fields into a string and use the dateutil module to convert it into a datetime object. For an example check this StackOverflow question.\n",

Make the same list for another week, and another week, and another week. plt.plot(week_count_list) for every week_count_list you created this way. You should get a rainbow plot of weekly commute numbers on top of each other.\n",
